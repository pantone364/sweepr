# Prompt

I want you to create a landing page for a sweepstakes website called “Sweepr.”

On this page, there is a modern/bold text logo centred at the top, and underneath is a large hero section with an image, heading and subheading. For now the image can be a placeholder, and we can use example text such as “Australians’ favourite sweepstakes” for the heading and something similar with a bit more detail for the subheading.

Underneath the hero section, there’s an ‘About’ section with a short bio paragraph about Sweepr (this can be a placeholder for now — you can generate a paragraph to use as an example that explains how Sweepr works with sweepstake holders all across the country to find and promote the best sweepstakes and giveaways currently available, as well as confirming legitimacy etc etc.

In the about section under the bio paragraph, there’s also 3 ‘feature’ divs equally spaced across the page that consist of a small icon, heading and subheading. For now, these icons and details can be placeholders/generated - let’s start with ‘Verified’, ‘Higher odds’ and ‘Quick to enter’.

The general ideas for these short feature areas are:

Verified: Sweepr verifies each sweepstake individually and those running them to ensure legitimate opportunities.

Higher odds: By verifying each sweepstake shown on Sweepr and displaying only relevant sweepstakes personalised to each user, you have higher odds of winning than other providers.

Quick to enter: Each sweepstake can be entered within a matter of minutes, and is a perfect opportunity to earn some extra cash/rewards when you have a few minutes of downtime, on a commute etc.

Underneath the feature section, there is the CTA/most important section, which is where you select your country.

Once your country has been selected, relevant images will be displayed neatly in a grid underneath the country selection dropdown that link to the respective sweepstake pages that are available in the country selected (these can be placeholders for now - I will update the images and links later), essentially filtering and displaying only the images/links that are valid for the country selected. Each icon slightly increases in size when hovered over.

Underneath this section, there is a ‘social proof section’, that shows 3 different testimonials. Each testimonial has a short paragraph which is the testimonial, and then a name, city and state, and a 5 star rating.

The design of the page should be modern and sleek - use the Coinbase.com homepage as a reference for design language and style, as well as the screenshots in the “designinspo” folder within the project.

Also, this page will most likely be visited primarily on mobile/tablet devices, so please ensure to place emphasis on a clean and responsive mobile design too - feel free to make adjustments to layout (e.g. reducing grids to singular columns on mobile) as needed for a responsive mobile design.
